# Brand-Perception-using-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Choosing between brands is always a hassle. The decision has to be a calculated one and in this process, lots of factors come in.
Public perception or opinion about the brand is one such factor. Several websites show ratings and reviews related to brands. These ratings are, in many cases, biased or skewed.
On the other hand, social media has become a hotspot of raw and honest opinions from circles vast and diverse, due to its open and accessible nature. Even with some form of censorship, people are more empathetic towards social media reviews than actual review websites.
With one such social media giant, Twitter, as our data source, we present a solution to this dilemma â€“ a brand comparison system, made using sentiment analysis in Python, that uses tweets to compare two (or more) brands, give us insights related to them and make a calculated decision as to which one is better and by how much using an overall rating system.
